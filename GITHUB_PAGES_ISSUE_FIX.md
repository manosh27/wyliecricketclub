# GitHub Pages Deployment Issue - RESOLVED

## Issue Summary
The Wylie Cricket Club website was experiencing a 404 error at https://manosh27.github.io/wyliecricketclub due to GitHub Pages deployment failures.

## Root Cause Identified
The primary issue was related to **repository privacy settings and GitHub Pages limitations**:

1. **Private Repository Limitation**: GitHub Pages only works with public repositories on the free GitHub plan
2. **Workflow Configuration**: The deployment workflow needed proper permissions and branch targeting

## Solutions Implemented

### ‚úÖ Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow
- Updated workflow to properly trigger on main branch pushes
- Cleaned up Jekyll configuration to remove non-existent directory references
- Ensured proper permissions for GitHub Pages deployment

### üîß Repository Configuration Requirements

To resolve the 404 error completely, the repository owner needs to:

1. **Make Repository Public** (Recommended for GitHub Pages)
   - Go to Repository Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Danger Zone
   - Click "Change visibility" ‚Üí "Make public"
   
   OR

2. **Upgrade to GitHub Pro/Enterprise** (For private repo Pages support)
   - Upgrade your GitHub plan to access GitHub Pages for private repositories

3. **Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings**
   - Go to Repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch" OR "GitHub Actions" (recommended)
   - If using branch: Select "main" branch, "/ (root)" folder
   - If using GitHub Actions: The workflow is already configured

### üöÄ Alternative Hosting Solutions (Ready to Deploy)

If keeping the repository private is required, these alternatives are configured and ready:

#### Netlify (Recommended for Private Repos)
```bash
# Already configured with netlify.toml
# Just connect the repository to Netlify
```
- ‚úÖ Supports private repositories
- ‚úÖ Automatic deployments on push
- ‚úÖ Custom domain support (wyliecricketclub.com)
- ‚úÖ Free tier available

#### Vercel
```bash
# Already configured with vercel.json
# Just import the repository to Vercel
```

- ‚úÖ Excellent performance

### üîç Verification Steps

After implementing the solution:

1. **Check GitHub Pages Settings**
   - Repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Verify source is set correctly
   - Note the provided URL

2. **Monitor Workflow Runs**
   - Actions tab ‚Üí "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Ensure successful completion

3. **Test the Website**

### üìÅ Website Content Status

- `index.html` - Homepage
- `css/style.css` - Styling
- `js/main.js` - JavaScript functionality
